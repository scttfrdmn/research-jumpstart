10 results






















Categorized emerging notebook platforms across cloud, enterprise, and open-source ecosystems.



Based on current information from late 2025, several notebook platforms have emerged alongside Jupyter:

Cloud-Based Collaborative Platforms
Deepnote - A cloud-based platform emphasizing real-time collaboration with zero setup, SQL integration, and the ability to query databases like BigQuery, Snowflake, and PostgreSQL directly within notebooks.

Google Colab - Remains extremely popular, especially for its free tier with GPU/TPU access. As of October 2025, it offers v5e TPUs and T4 GPUs on the free tier.

Hex - Combines notebooks with SQL and no-code components to build data apps and dashboards. Particularly strong for creating interactive applications that can be shared with non-technical users.

Datalore - JetBrains' offering with a clean UI that's accessible for those transitioning from spreadsheet environments.

Reactive & Modern Notebooks
marimo - An open-source reactive Python notebook where cells automatically update when dependencies change. Unlike Jupyter, it's stored as pure Python (git-friendly), eliminates hidden state, and can be deployed as web apps. It's gaining traction as a serious Jupyter alternative in late 2025.

Quadratic - Takes a radical approach by blending spreadsheets with code, allowing Python, SQL, JavaScript, and AI agents to coexist in a multiplayer grid interface.

Enterprise Platforms
Databricks Notebooks - Part of the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform, optimized for large-scale data engineering and ML workflows.

AWS SageMaker - Amazon's managed platform with support for multiple GPU types, though with some configuration constraints.

Azure Notebooks - Microsoft's Jupyter notebook hosting on Azure.

Other Notable Platforms
Apache Zeppelin - Supports multiple languages (SQL, Python, Scala, R) with strong visualization capabilities.

Modal - A newer player focusing on serverless notebooks with sub-5-second cold starts and efficient GPU access.

JupyterLab - The evolution of Jupyter Notebook itself, with improved multi-document interface and extensions for Git integration.

The trend in late 2025 is clearly toward cloud-based, collaborative platforms with built-in database connectivity, real-time collaboration, and easier deployment options compared to traditional Jupyter.

Modal notebook platform 2025 serverless
10 results






















Synthesized comprehensive details about marimo and Modal platforms.

marimo
marimo is a revolutionary open-source Python notebook that fundamentally reimagines how notebooks work. Here are its key features:

Core Innovation: Reactive Execution
Unlike Jupyter's sequential execution, marimo uses reactive programming. When you modify a cell, marimo automatically runs all dependent cells, eliminating hidden state and keeping code and outputs synchronized. This solves one of Jupyter's biggest problems - about 75% of Jupyter notebooks on GitHub don't run, and 96% don't reproduce.

Stored as Pure Python
marimo notebooks are saved as .py files, not JSON. This makes them:

Git-friendly with clean diffs
Executable as Python scripts
Importable as modules in other projects
Testable with pytest
Compatible with AI coding assistants like Claude Code (which struggle with Jupyter's JSON format)
Three-in-One Tool
A single marimo notebook can be:

A notebook for interactive development
A Python script you can run from command line
A web app deployed with one click (similar to Streamlit but integrated)
Built-in Features
Interactive UI elements: Sliders, dropdowns, tables without callbacks
SQL support: Built-in SQL cells for querying databases (DuckDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
AI integration: GitHub Copilot, AI assistants, OpenAI, Gemini support
Modern editor: LSP support, auto-completion, code formatting with Ruff
Data Explorer: Visual dataframe editor and instant visualization tool
VS Code extension: Works in VS Code or Cursor
Cloud Hosting
molab (launched in 2025) provides cloud-hosted marimo notebooks similar to Google Colab, running on Modal's infrastructure.

Who's Using It
Trusted by teams at Stanford, Mozilla AI, OpenAI, and BlackRock. It's gaining significant traction as a serious Jupyter replacement in late 2025.

Modal
Modal is a serverless cloud platform specifically designed for AI/ML workloads, launched its notebook product in August/September 2025.

Core Value Proposition
Modal Notebooks solve the biggest pain points of cloud notebooks: slow startup times and wasted compute costs from idle instances.

Speed: The Killer Feature
Sub-5-second cold starts even for custom images
Boot GPUs in seconds (including up to 8 NVIDIA H100 or B200 GPUs)
Makes cloud computing feel as immediate as local development
One user noted: "Tasks that used to take days now take minutes"
Serverless Pricing Model
Pay only for active compute, down to the second
Eliminates "zombie boxes" - idle sessions that waste money
No more forgetting to shut down expensive GPU instances
$30/month free compute tier
Real-Time Collaboration
Google Docs-style collaborative editing
Multiple users can edit simultaneously with live cursors
Shared outputs including interactive Jupyter Widgets
First implementation of widgets in a real-time collaborative environment
Integration with Modal Ecosystem
Notebooks have direct access to:

Modal Volumes: Petabyte-scale persistent storage (VolumeFS)
Modal Functions: Deployed serverless functions
Modal Secrets: Secure credential management
Seamless path from prototype to production without rewriting code
Technical Architecture
Built on Modal Sandboxes: secure, isolated containers
Global distributed storage system
Supports hundreds of CPUs and top-tier NVIDIA GPUs
Custom infrastructure designed for AI/ML workloads
Additional Features
Link-based sharing for stakeholders
Language Server Protocol integration (Pyright)
Semantic highlighting and intelligent completions
Can embed Jupyter Widgets for interactivity
Who's Using It
Companies like Suno use it for sharing ML research and models across teams. During one promotional weekend, Modal spun up over 1 million sandboxes for a single customer.

Key Differences
marimo is best for:

Teams wanting Git-friendly, reproducible notebooks
Projects that need to be both notebooks AND production scripts
Developers frustrated with Jupyter's hidden state issues
Local development with option for cloud (via molab)
Open-source enthusiasts
Modal is best for:

Teams needing instant access to powerful GPUs
Compute-intensive ML training and inference
Organizations wanting serverless cost model
Real-time collaborative research
Teams already using Modal for deployment
Both represent the cutting edge of notebook innovation in late 2025, addressing different but complementary pain points in the data science workflow.

MOdal is not open source though

Dec 7

Acknowledged and rectified licensing distinction between platforms.



You're absolutely correct - that's an important distinction I should have emphasized more clearly.

Modal is a proprietary, commercial platform. It's a paid serverless cloud service with pricing based on compute usage. While they offer a free tier ($30/month in free compute), the platform itself is closed-source and you're using their infrastructure as a service.

marimo, on the other hand, is fully open source (Apache 2.0 license). You can:

Run it entirely locally for free
Self-host it on your own infrastructure
Inspect and modify the source code
Use it without any vendor lock-in
The comparison should really be:

marimo
Open source - free to use, modify, and self-host
Can run entirely locally
Optional cloud service (molab) built on Modal's infrastructure
No vendor lock-in
Modal Notebooks
Proprietary commercial service
Cloud-only platform
Pay-as-you-go pricing (though with free tier)
Vendor lock-in to Modal's infrastructure
Focus on serverless GPU compute
So if open source is important to you (for transparency, cost control, self-hosting, or avoiding vendor lock-in), marimo is the clear choice. Modal is more about paying for convenience and serverless infrastructure - you're essentially renting their highly optimized GPU infrastructure rather than managing it yourself.

Thanks for catching that - it's a crucial difference between these two platforms!

Does molab have a free tier?

molab marimo cloud free tier pricing 2025
10 results






















Unearthed clear pricing details about molab.

Yes! molab is currently free to use, with the caveat that "usage is reasonable."

According to their documentation:

"molab is currently free to use, as long as usage is reasonable. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for our community to use marimo notebooks."

Key Points About molab's Free Tier:
Completely free - no paid tiers currently, just free access
"Reasonable usage" - they ask users to be mindful of compute resources
Apply for more resources - if you need additional RAM, CPU, or GPUs, you can fill out a form to request more compute
Persistent storage - notebooks get persistent storage backed by Cloudflare R2
Share by URL - you can share notebooks with others via links (read-only interactive apps with /app appended)
Recent Update (November 2025):
marimo was acquired by CoreWeave, and they've announced plans for a "more generous free tier" along with the ability to run on larger instances, GPUs, and longer-lived sessions. So the free offering is actually expected to get better.

molab vs Modal Notebooks pricing:
molab: Currently 100% free (backed by CoreWeave infrastructure)
Modal Notebooks: $30/month free tier, then pay-as-you-go for compute usage
So if you want to try marimo in the cloud without any cost at all, molab is an excellent option. And since marimo is open source, you can always run it locally for free if you want complete control.

Could I run a molab "notebook" on Sagemaker Studio Lab? or Sagemaker Studio?

marimo notebook SageMaker Studio install run
10 results






















Examined marimo's architecture and SageMaker compatibility constraints.



Yes, you can run marimo notebooks in SageMaker environments, but with some important caveats about how it works:

Technical Feasibility
Since marimo is just a Python package (pip install marimo), you can install it in both SageMaker Studio and SageMaker Studio Lab. However, the experience differs from running traditional Jupyter notebooks:

How marimo works differently:
marimo notebooks are .py files, not .ipynb files
marimo runs its own web server (not a Jupyter kernel)
You access marimo through its own web interface at localhost:2720 (or similar)
Running marimo on SageMaker Studio/Studio Lab
Option 1: Install and run marimo server
bash
# In a SageMaker terminal
pip install marimo
marimo edit notebook.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 2720
Challenges:

You'd need to configure port forwarding/tunneling to access the marimo web UI
SageMaker is designed around Jupyter, so the network setup may require additional configuration
The marimo server would need to stay running
Option 2: Convert and run as Python script
bash
# Run marimo notebook as a regular Python script
python notebook.py
This works but you lose the interactive notebook interface - it just executes the code.

Option 3: Use Jupyter to view (limited)
You could open marimo .py files in JupyterLab as text/code files, but you wouldn't get the reactive marimo experience - just syntax highlighting.

Better Alternatives
Given the architectural mismatch, I'd recommend:

Use molab instead (easiest)
Free cloud hosting specifically for marimo
No setup required
Purpose-built for marimo notebooks
Better experience than trying to shoehorn marimo into SageMaker
Use SageMaker for what it's designed for
Keep using Jupyter notebooks in SageMaker Studio/Lab
Use marimo locally or on molab when you want reactive notebooks
Convert between formats as needed: marimo convert notebook.ipynb -o notebook.py
Bottom Line
While technically possible to install marimo in SageMaker, it's not the intended use case. SageMaker is built around Jupyter, and you'd be fighting against that architecture. Since molab is free and purpose-built for cloud-hosted marimo notebooks, that's a much better option for running marimo in the cloud without managing your own infrastructure.

If you specifically need AWS infrastructure, you might consider running marimo on an EC2 instance or in a container, but for most use cases, molab is the simpler choice.

What if I work for AWS and I want to show folks how to run Marimo on AWS (in Sagemaker)

SageMaker Studio custom notebook server port forwarding web app
10 results






















Identified jupyter-server-proxy solution for marimo SageMaker integration.

Excellent! Now we're talking about a demonstration/tutorial use case. Here are several approaches you could take to showcase marimo on AWS SageMaker, ranked from easiest to most feature-complete:

Approach 1: Use jupyter-server-proxy (RECOMMENDED for demos)
This is the most practical approach for a tutorial. SageMaker supports jupyter-server-proxy, which allows you to access web applications running on custom ports.

Implementation Steps:
1. Install dependencies in SageMaker Studio/Notebook:

bash
# In a terminal
pip install marimo jupyter-server-proxy
2. Configure jupyter-server-proxy (can be done via lifecycle configuration):

bash
# Update jupyter-server-proxy
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyter_server_proxy
3. Start marimo server:

bash
marimo edit --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888
```

**4. Access via proxy URL:**
```
https://<your-instance>.notebook.<region>.sagemaker.aws/proxy/8888/
```

**Example for SageMaker Studio:**
```
https://<your-domain>.studio.<region>.sagemaker.aws/jupyter/default/proxy/8888/
Reference Implementation
The Aim UI documentation shows exactly this pattern for SageMaker - you can adapt it for marimo: Aim on SageMaker example

Approach 2: SageMaker Lifecycle Configuration
Create a reusable lifecycle configuration that sets up marimo automatically.

Create a lifecycle config script:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Install marimo and jupyter-server-proxy
pip install marimo jupyter-server-proxy

# Enable jupyter-server-proxy
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyter_server_proxy

# Optionally: Auto-start marimo on a specific notebook
# nohup marimo edit /home/sagemaker-user/demo_notebook.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 &
This would be a great AWS blog post topic: "Running Modern Python Notebooks with marimo on SageMaker Studio"

Approach 3: Custom SageMaker Studio Image
For a more polished, production-ready demo, create a custom Studio image with marimo pre-installed.

Dockerfile example:

dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/sagemaker/sagemaker-distribution:latest

RUN pip install marimo jupyter-server-proxy

# Optional: Include sample notebooks
COPY sample_notebooks/ /home/sagemaker-user/notebooks/

EXPOSE 8888
Then follow AWS documentation for custom images.

Approach 4: Run marimo as a Script/App (Simplest Demo)
For the quickest demo, skip the interactive server and show marimo's other strengths:

1. Convert Jupyter → marimo:

bash
marimo convert existing_notebook.ipynb -o marimo_version.py
2. Run as script:

bash
python marimo_version.py
3. Deploy as web app:

bash
marimo run marimo_version.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
# Access via proxy: /proxy/8080/
Approach 5: SageMaker SSH Helper for Advanced Demos
For full port forwarding (most flexible but complex), use the sagemaker-ssh-helper:

bash
# Local machine
sm-ssh connect <notebook-instance-name>
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 <instance>
```

Then access marimo at `localhost:8888` on your local machine.

## 4. Blog Post Outline

# Running marimo: The Next-Generation Python Notebook on Amazon SageMaker

## Introduction (2-3 paragraphs)

Machine learning practitioners have long relied on Jupyter notebooks for interactive development, but traditional notebooks come with well-known challenges: hidden state, out-of-order execution, and Git conflicts from JSON formatting. Enter **marimo**, an open-source reactive notebook that fundamentally reimagines how notebooks work.

In this post, we'll show you how to run marimo on Amazon SageMaker Studio, combining the power of AWS's managed ML platform with marimo's modern notebook experience. Whether you're doing exploratory data analysis, training models, or building ML pipelines, this integration gives you the best of both worlds.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to deploy a complete SageMaker Studio environment with marimo support using infrastructure as code (Terraform or AWS CDK), and understand when and how to use marimo for your ML workflows.

## What is marimo? (Section 1)

### Key Features
- **Reactive execution**: Cells automatically update when dependencies change
- **Stored as Python**: `.py` files instead of JSON—perfect for Git
- **No hidden state**: Deterministic execution eliminates common notebook bugs
- **Three tools in one**: Notebook, script, and web app
- **Built-in interactivity**: UI widgets without callbacks

### Why marimo on SageMaker?
- Leverage SageMaker's managed infrastructure
- Access to scalable compute (GPUs, large instances)
- Integration with SageMaker features (training jobs, endpoints, Feature Store)
- Share reproducible notebooks with your team
- Version control friendly workflows

         └─→ SageMaker APIs
Components:
SageMaker Studio Domain: Your team's workspace
Lifecycle Configuration: Automated marimo installation
jupyter-server-proxy: Enables accessing marimo's web UI
VPC Configuration: Secure networking
IAM Roles: Permissions for SageMaker operations
Deployment Options (Section 3)
Option 1: Deploy with Terraform
bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
Key resources created:

SageMaker Studio Domain
User profiles
VPC and security groups
S3 bucket for artifacts
Lifecycle configuration
Option 2: Deploy with AWS CDK
bash
cd cdk
pip install -r requirements.txt
cdk deploy
Both options create identical infrastructure, choose based on your team's preference.

Getting Started with marimo (Section 4)
Step 1: Access SageMaker Studio
Navigate to SageMaker Console
Open Studio (use output URL from deployment)
Wait for JupyterServer to start
Step 2: Start marimo
Open a terminal in JupyterLab:

bash
./start-marimo.sh
Step 3: Access marimo UI
Navigate to: https://<your-domain>/jupyter/default/proxy/8888/

Step 4: Create Your First Notebook
bash
cd marimo-notebooks
marimo edit my_analysis.py
Use Cases and Examples (Section 5)
Use Case 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
python
import marimo as mo
import pandas as pd

# Interactive data filtering
slider = mo.ui.slider(0, 100, value=50)
filtered_data = data[data['value'] > slider.value]
mo.ui.table(filtered_data)
Use Case 2: SageMaker Training Job Monitoring
python
import boto3
sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')

# Reactive monitoring
job_selector = mo.ui.dropdown(training_jobs)
job_status = sagemaker.describe_training_job(
    TrainingJobName=job_selector.value
)
mo.ui.chart(plot_metrics(job_status))
Use Case 3: Model Deployment Pipeline
python
# Script execution mode
if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = train_model(data)
    deploy_to_endpoint(model)
marimo vs. Jupyter: When to Use Each (Section 6)
Use marimo when:
✅ Building interactive dashboards
✅ Needing reproducible research
✅ Working with version control
✅ Creating reusable modules
✅ Want reactive execution
Use Jupyter when:
✅ Exploring ad-hoc analysis
✅ Using SageMaker-specific features (Studio notebooks)
✅ Team already invested in Jupyter
✅ Need specific Jupyter extensions
Best practice: Use both! Convert between formats as needed.

Best Practices (Section 7)
1. Version Control
bash
# marimo notebooks are just Python files
git add my_notebook.py
git commit -m "Add analysis notebook"
git push
2. Converting Existing Notebooks
bash
marimo convert existing.ipynb -o marimo_version.py
3. Team Deployment
Use lifecycle configurations for consistent environments
Store notebooks in S3 or CodeCommit
Create custom SageMaker images for dependencies
4. Resource Management
marimo runs on JupyterServer (minimal cost)
Kernel Gateway handles compute
Use SageMaker training jobs for heavy workloads
Cost Optimization (Section 8)
JupyterServer: ~$0.05/hour (system instance)
Kernel Gateway: Varies by instance type
Storage: S3 standard pricing
Data transfer: Minimal within VPC
Tip: marimo's lightweight server means lower costs compared to running heavyweight notebook environments.

Troubleshooting (Section 9)
Common Issues:
Issue: Can't access marimo UI

bash
# Check if proxy is working
jupyter serverextension list
# Should show jupyter_server_proxy enabled
Issue: Lifecycle config didn't run

Check CloudWatch logs: /aws/sagemaker/studio
Verify IAM permissions
Issue: Packages missing

bash
# Install in JupyterServer terminal
pip install <package>
# Or add to lifecycle configuration
Advanced Topics (Section 10)
Custom Images
Build Docker images with marimo pre-installed:

dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/sagemaker/sagemaker-distribution:latest
RUN pip install marimo jupyter-server-proxy
CI/CD Integration
yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Test marimo notebooks
  run: |
    python notebook.py  # Runs as script
Multi-user Setup
One lifecycle config for entire domain
Per-user customizations via user settings
Shared notebooks in S3
Conclusion (Section 11)
marimo brings modern reactive programming to SageMaker Studio, enabling reproducible, version-controlled notebooks that integrate seamlessly with AWS services. Whether you're doing exploratory analysis or building production ML pipelines, this combination gives you powerful tools for interactive development.
