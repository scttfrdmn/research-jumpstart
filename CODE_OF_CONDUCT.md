# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in Research Jumpstart a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with those learning new technologies or concepts
* Sharing knowledge and helping others succeed

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Gatekeeping or dismissing others based on their level of expertise
* Belittling questions or concerns from community members
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests
* Discussion forums and chat channels
* Email correspondence
* Social media interactions
* In-person or virtual events (workshops, office hours, conferences)
* Any other spaces where community members interact

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**📧 Email**: conduct@researchjumpstart.org

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

**What to include in your report**:
* Your contact information
* Names (real, usernames, or pseudonyms) of those involved
* Description of the incident, including:
  - What happened
  - Where it happened (GitHub issue, Slack, email, etc.)
  - When it happened
  - Whether the incident is ongoing
* Any additional context or documentation (screenshots, links, etc.)
* Whether you've reported this to anyone else
* Any other information you believe we should have

### Confidentiality

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. We will:

* Keep your identity confidential unless you explicitly agree otherwise
* Not share details of the report publicly without your permission
* Only share information internally among community leaders as necessary for investigation and resolution

### Investigation Process

1. **Acknowledgment** (within 24 hours)
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your report
   - Provide an estimated timeline for investigation

2. **Investigation** (typically 3-7 days)
   - Review all available information and documentation
   - May contact the reporter for additional information
   - May contact witnesses or others involved
   - Determine whether the Code of Conduct was violated

3. **Decision & Action** (within 14 days of initial report)
   - Determine appropriate consequences
   - Communicate decision to involved parties
   - Take enforcement action

4. **Follow-up**
   - Check in with reporter to ensure resolution
   - Monitor for retaliation or further issues

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Example**: Using language that makes others uncomfortable, making an insensitive joke, or minor unprofessional behavior.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Example**: Repeated inappropriate behavior after correction, making someone feel unwelcome, or dismissing concerns raised by community members.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Example**: Harassment, aggressive behavior, or pattern of violations after warning.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

**Example**: Severe harassment, doxxing, persistent violations, threats of violence, or any behavior that makes the community unsafe.

## Retaliation

Retaliation against anyone who reports a violation, provides information about a violation, or participates in an investigation is itself a violation of this Code of Conduct and will be taken seriously.

If you experience or witness retaliation, please report it immediately using the same process as reporting Code of Conduct violations.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was unjust, you may appeal by:

1. Sending an email to appeals@researchjumpstart.org within 14 days of the decision
2. Including:
   - The original incident report (if available)
   - Why you believe the decision was unfair
   - Any additional information that wasn't previously considered
3. A different community leader will review the appeal
4. The appeals decision is final

## Special Considerations for Research Community

### Academic Disagreement vs. Code of Conduct Violations

**Academic disagreement is encouraged**. We expect:
* Respectful debate about methods, results, and interpretations
* Questioning of assumptions and approaches
* Constructive criticism of research workflows

**This is NOT a Code of Conduct violation**:
* "I think approach X is better than approach Y because..."
* "Have you considered this alternative method?"
* "The documentation could be clearer about..."

**This IS a Code of Conduct violation**:
* "That's a stupid approach"
* "You clearly don't know what you're doing"
* "Researchers who use method X are incompetent"

### Expertise Levels

Our community includes everyone from undergraduate students to senior researchers, from domain experts to those just learning cloud computing. We celebrate this diversity!

**Encouraged**:
* Asking basic questions
* Admitting when you don't know something
* Learning in public
* Helping others learn

**Not acceptable**:
* Dismissing questions as "too basic"
* Gatekeeping based on credentials or experience
* Making assumptions about someone's expertise
* Using jargon to exclude or intimidate

### Institutional Hierarchies

Academic environments often have power dynamics (professor/student, tenure track/non-tenure, etc.). In this community:

* Everyone has equal standing regardless of academic rank
* Junior researchers should feel safe providing feedback
* Senior researchers should model inclusive behavior
* Power dynamics from institutions should not carry over here
