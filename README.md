## What is Research Jumpstart?

Research Jumpstart provides production-ready research workflows that help academic researchers transition from traditional computing to cloud-based analysis. Each project includes:

✅ **Free Tier Option** - Try in SageMaker Studio Lab (no AWS account needed)
✅ **Production Version** - Scale to AWS Unified Studio when ready
✅ **Transition Guides** - Step-by-step from free to production
✅ **Real Research** - Built by researchers, for researchers
✅ **Open Source** - Community-driven and customizable

## Project Tiers: Start Free, Scale When Ready

Research Jumpstart organizes projects into **4 tiers** (0-3) to support your journey from learning to production:

| Tier | Name | Duration | Platform | Cost | Best For |
|------|------|----------|----------|------|----------|
| **0** | Quick Start | 60-90 min | Colab/Studio Lab | **$0** | Learning fundamentals |
| **1** | Extended Analysis | 4-8 hours | Studio Lab | **$0** | Real datasets, deeper exploration |
| **2** | Production Ready | 2-3 days | AWS | $200-500 | Research publications, grants |
| **3** | Enterprise Scale | Weeks | AWS | $2K-5K/month | Lab/department-wide platforms |

**Start with Tier 0**: All 25 tier-0 projects are free, fast (60-90 min), and require no AWS account.
