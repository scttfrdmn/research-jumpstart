## What is Research Jumpstart?

Research Jumpstart provides production-ready research workflows that help academic researchers transition from traditional computing to cloud-based analysis. Each project includes:

✅ **Free Tier Option** - Try in SageMaker Studio Lab (no AWS account needed)
✅ **Production Version** - Scale to AWS Unified Studio when ready
✅ **Transition Guides** - Step-by-step from free to production
✅ **Real Research** - Built by researchers, for researchers
✅ **Open Source** - Community-driven and customizable

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose a Project
