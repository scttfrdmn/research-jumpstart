# Historical Text Analysis & Corpus Linguistics

**Difficulty**: 🟢 Beginner | **Time**: ⏱️ 2-3 hours (Studio Lab)

Apply NLP and computational methods to analyze historical texts, identify themes, track language evolution, and perform stylometric analysis.

## Status

**Studio Lab**: 🚧 Lightweight quickstart (in development)
**Unified Studio**: ⏳ Planned

## Quick Start (Studio Lab)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/research-jumpstart/research-jumpstart.git
cd research-jumpstart/projects/digital-humanities/text-analysis/studio-lab
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate text-analysis
jupyter notebook quickstart.ipynb
```

## What You'll Learn

- Load and process historical texts
- Frequency analysis and word distributions
- Topic modeling for thematic analysis
- Stylometric analysis (author attribution)
- Named entity recognition (people, places, events)
- Temporal language change tracking
- Text similarity and comparison

## Key Analyses

1. **Lexical Analysis**
   - Word frequency distributions
   - Vocabulary richness (TTR, Herd's D)
   - Hapax legomena identification

2. **Topic Modeling**
   - LDA for theme extraction
   - Topic evolution over time
   - Thematic comparison across texts

3. **Stylometry**
   - Function word analysis
   - Sentence length patterns
   - Authorship attribution

4. **Named Entity Recognition**
   - Extract people, places, organizations
   - Build knowledge graphs
   - Track entity mentions over time

## Sample Data

Collection of public domain texts:
- Shakespeare sonnets
- Historical speeches
- 19th century novels (excerpts)
- Educational/demonstration purposes

## Cost

**Studio Lab**: Free forever
**Unified Studio**: ~$10-20 per analysis (HathiTrust datasets)

## Use Cases

- Literary analysis and comparison
- Historical discourse analysis
- Author attribution studies
- Language evolution tracking
- Cultural heritage preservation
