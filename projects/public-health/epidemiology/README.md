# Epidemiology & Disease Surveillance

**Difficulty**: 🟢 Beginner | **Time**: ⏱️ 2-3 hours (Studio Lab)

Model disease outbreaks, analyze epidemic curves, forecast infection trends, and evaluate public health interventions.

## Status

**Studio Lab**: 🚧 Lightweight quickstart (in development)
**Unified Studio**: ⏳ Planned

## What You'll Learn

- Compartmental models (SIR, SEIR, SIRD)
- Epidemic curve analysis
- Basic reproduction number (R₀) estimation
- Time series forecasting of cases
- Geographic spread visualization
- Intervention effectiveness evaluation

## Key Analyses

1. **SIR Model**: Susceptible-Infected-Recovered dynamics
2. **Parameter Estimation**: Fit models to outbreak data
3. **R₀ Calculation**: Transmission potential assessment
4. **Forecasting**: Predict future case counts
5. **Spatial Analysis**: Geographic disease mapping

## Sample Data

- COVID-19 case data (JHU, WHO)
- Historical outbreak data (flu, measles, Ebola)
- Vaccination coverage statistics
- Hospital capacity and mortality data

## Tools & Resources

- **Python**: scipy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- **R**: EpiModel, surveillance packages
- **Data**: WHO, CDC, ECDC, Our World in Data

## Use Cases

- Outbreak prediction and response
- Vaccination campaign planning
- Healthcare resource allocation
- Policy impact assessment

## Cost

**Studio Lab**: Free (public health data)
**Unified Studio**: ~$10-20/month (real-time dashboards, large datasets)
