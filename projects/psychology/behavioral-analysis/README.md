# Large-Scale Behavioral Data Analysis

**Tier 1 Flagship Project**

Analyze massive behavioral datasets from online experiments, mobile apps, and cognitive assessments using machine learning on AWS.

## Quick Start

The main implementation is in the [`unified-studio/`](unified-studio/) directory.

**[→ View Full Documentation](unified-studio/README.md)**

## Features

- **Massive scale:** Millions of participants from online platforms, mobile apps
- **Cognitive tests:** Memory, attention, decision-making tasks at scale
- **Mental health:** Depression prediction (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), EMA
- **ML models:** Predict outcomes, personality traits, treatment response
- **Real-time:** Process streaming behavioral data from mobile apps

## Cost Estimate

**$700-1,300** for complete research study (50K participants, 6-month study)

## Technologies

- **ML:** XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Survival Analysis
- **AWS:** S3, Kinesis, SageMaker, QuickSight, Comprehend, Bedrock
- **Analysis:** Cognitive tests, EMA, social behavior, experiments
- **Streaming:** Real-time analytics with Kinesis
- **Visualization:** QuickSight dashboards

## Applications

1. **Cognitive psychology:** Attention, memory, learning at scale
2. **Clinical psychology:** Predict depression, anxiety, PTSD risk
3. **Personality:** Big Five traits from digital footprints
4. **Social behavior:** Cooperation, trust, social influence
5. **Experiments:** Online studies with thousands of participants
