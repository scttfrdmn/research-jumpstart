# Crop Health from Satellite Data - Tier 3 Starter

Introduction to agricultural remote sensing through vegetation index analysis.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate crop-health

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab quickstart.ipynb
```

## Topics Covered

- Vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI)
- Spectral reflectance analysis
- Temporal crop monitoring
- Spatial pattern detection
- Health classification

## Sample Data

100 field observations over growing season:
- Multi-spectral satellite data (Red, NIR, Blue, Green)
- 4 crop types across 5 months
- Realistic reflectance values
