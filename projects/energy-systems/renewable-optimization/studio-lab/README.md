# Solar Panel Optimization - Tier 3 Starter

Introduction to renewable energy through solar panel performance analysis.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate solar-optimization

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab quickstart.ipynb
```

## Topics Covered

- Solar irradiance and power output
- Temperature effects on efficiency
- Panel orientation optimization
- Time-of-day production patterns
- Economic analysis (LCOE, payback)

## Sample Data

1 year of hourly solar data:
- Irradiance measurements (W/m²)
- Temperature and weather conditions
- Power output from 50 kW system
- Electricity prices
