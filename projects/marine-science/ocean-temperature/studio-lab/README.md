# Ocean Temperature Trends - Tier 3 Starter

Introduction to oceanography through sea surface temperature analysis.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ocean-temp

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab quickstart.ipynb
```

## Topics Covered

- Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis
- Seasonal decomposition
- Trend detection and climate change
- Temperature anomalies
- Depth profile analysis

## Sample Data

10 years of monthly ocean observations:
- Multiple depth levels (surface to 500m)
- 3 monitoring stations
- Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen
