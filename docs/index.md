## What is Research Jumpstart?

Research Jumpstart helps academic researchers transition from traditional computing (laptops, local HPC) to cloud-based research workflows. We provide production-ready, tested projects across 20+ research domains.

### The Problem

Researchers struggle to adopt cloud computing due to:

- 🤔 **Steep learning curve** - Cloud platforms are complex
- 💰 **Unclear costs** - Fear of surprise bills
- 🚧 **No starting point** - Where do I even begin?
- ⏱️ **Time constraints** - Too busy to learn new tools
- 🏛️ **Institutional barriers** - IT approval, procurement, etc.

### Our Solution

Research Jumpstart provides:

✅ **Free Tier Access** - Start with SageMaker Studio Lab (no AWS account)
✅ **Production Templates** - Scale to Unified Studio when ready
✅ **Transition Guides** - Step-by-step from free to production
✅ **Domain-Specific Projects** - Real research, not toy examples
✅ **Honest Guidance** - Transparent costs, realistic timelines
✅ **Community Support** - Learn from other researchers
